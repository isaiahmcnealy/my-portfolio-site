# Isaiah's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Portfolio Website! This is my digital playground where I showcase the cool projects I've been working on. Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just someone who stumbled upon this page, I hope you find something that piques your interest.

## What's This All About?

I built this portfolio to have a central hub for all my projects, experiences, and to share a bit about myself. Think of it as a living resume that evolves as I do. It's like my personal highlight reel where I get to show off the things I'm passionate about and the skills I've honed over the years.

## Why I Made It

As a software engineer, I've worked on a bunch of exciting projects and learned a ton along the way. But it's not enough to just have these experiences; I wanted a way to present them in an engaging and interactive way. Plus, having a personal website is a great way to stand out to potential employers and collaborators. It's my way of saying, "Hey, this is what I can do. Let's build something amazing together!"

## Technologies Used

I'm all about using the right tools for the job, so this website is built with some pretty awesome tech:

- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Next.js**: To leverage server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: Because type safety and better tooling make development a breeze.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and easy styling that's also highly customizable.

## Work in Progress

Just like any good project, this website is a work in progress. I'm constantly updating it, adding new projects, and tweaking the design. So if you see something that looks unfinished or a feature you'd like to see, stay tuned – it's probably on my to-do list!

## Building It Locally

Want to check it out on your own machine? Awesome! Here's how you can get it up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-website
   
3. **Install the dependencies:**
